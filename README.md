## Project Overview

This project analyzes the evolution of the Bank of Canada's balance sheet before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic dramatically altered the global financial landscape, and the Bank of Canada's balance sheet reflects the changes that occurred in response to the crisis. This analysis focuses on three key periods: 
1. **Pre-COVID (Stable Growth)** – The balance sheet shows gradual growth aligned with economic cycles.
2. **During COVID (Crisis Intervention)** – Significant expansion of assets and liabilities driven by government interventions, asset purchase programs, and liquidity injections.
3. **Post-COVID Recovery (Normalization)**—A gradual decline in the balance sheet signals the easing of emergency measures and a return to pre-pandemic levels.

## Key Objectives

- **Visualize the balance sheet** trends across the three time periods.
- **Highlight the extraordinary measures** taken by the Bank of Canada during COVID-19 to stabilize financial markets.
- **Analyze the recovery** and normalization process post-2022, including the impact on assets, liabilities, and financial stability.

1. **Pre-COVID (2018 - early 2020)**:
   - The balance sheet shows a stable trend, with minor fluctuations corresponding to typical economic cycles.
  
2. **During COVID (2020 - 2022)**:
   - Sharp increase in both assets and liabilities due to the Bank of Canada's large-scale asset purchases and liquidity support measures.
   - The primary drivers include government bond purchases (particularly short-term bonds) to ensure financial stability and credit availability.

3. **Post-COVID Recovery (2022 - Present)**:
   - Gradual reduction of assets and liabilities, signaling a normalization of the Bank’s balance sheet as emergency measures are rolled back.
   - The focus is now on managing inflation and other macroeconomic challenges while returning to a stable financial environment.

## Conclusion

This analysis provides insight into how the Bank of Canada adapted its balance sheet to manage the economic impact of COVID-19 and how it is now transitioning back to normalcy. The visualization highlights key interventions and their effects on the financial system during one of the most volatile periods in recent history.

**Storyline: The Evolution of the Bank of Canada's Balance Sheet: Pre-COVID, During COVID, and Post-COVID Recovery**

The COVID-19 pandemic dramatically altered the global financial landscape, and the Bank of Canada's balance sheet provides a clear reflection of these changes. **Pre-COVID**, the Bank maintained a relatively stable balance of assets and liabilities, with gradual growth that aligned with typical economic cycles. However, as the pandemic struck in early 2020, economic uncertainty surged, leading to unprecedented government interventions and policy measures. 

During the peak of the crisis, the Bank of Canada's assets and liabilities skyrocketed. This spike was driven by large-scale asset purchase programs and liquidity injections to support businesses, households, and financial markets. These extraordinary measures were vital in cushioning the economic blow, ensuring liquidity in the financial system, and stabilizing the economy during a period of extreme volatility.

In this period, the Bankâ€™s extraordinary measures, including its government bond purchases, played a vital role in keeping financial markets stable and ensuring continued access to credit for businesses and individuals. The bond purchases, particularly short-term bonds, were key in managing the immediate financial impact of the pandemic. 

As the pandemic's effects began to subside and economic conditions improved from **2022 onwards**, the Bank of Canada gradually shifted its focus from emergency measures to recovery and normalization. This shift is visible in the data, as assets and liabilities have steadily declined, signaling a reduction in intervention and a return toward pre-pandemic balance sheet levels. However, the pace of this recovery continues to be monitored closely, with ongoing adjustments to manage inflation and other macroeconomic factors.

The visualization of these shifts over time highlights the crucial role the Bank of Canada played in navigating the country through one of its most challenging economic periods, showing both the rapid expansion of the balance sheet in response to the crisis and the deliberate efforts to return to normalcy in its aftermath.
